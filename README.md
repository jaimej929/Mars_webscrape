# Mars_webscrape

## General Info
The purpose this project is to gather data by creating a scrape app that takes information from certain websites, then saving the data into a databse to then project them into an html file showing what was gathered from the scrape by also using an app.py.

## Setup
To run the data I first used jupyternotebook to make sure the scraping itself worked properly before transfering into vcode and create an app.py. the html index was created to display the page with the gatehred data.

## Some example
